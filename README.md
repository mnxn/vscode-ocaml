For syntax highlighting of .mll and .mly files (plus lots of other features) use the [ocaml-platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform) extension.

## vscode-ocaml-mll-mly

Fork of https://github.com/hackwaly/vscode-ocaml to isolate highlighting support for just OCamllex (.mll) and OCamlyacc/Menhir (.mly) files
